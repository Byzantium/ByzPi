  * Backported the "Can't find any wireless interfaces" error handler.
  * Updated daemon to latest stable version from Git.
  * Patched for Debian's idiosyncracies.
  * Updating list of dependencies because I got a few things wrong.
  * Removed dependency on captive-portal-daemon because it was hamstringing
    testing.

autoconfigd (0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
  * This is the automatic configuration daemon that I hacked while we were
    in Red Hook last year.  It takes all of the configuration steps that used
    to be in the control panel and automates them.  This script is called from
    /etc/rc.local at boot-time.
