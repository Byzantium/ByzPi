autoconfigd (0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
  * This is the automatic configuration daemon that I hacked while we were
    in Red Hook last year.  It takes all of the configuration steps that used
    to be in the control panel and automates them.  This script is called from
    /etc/rc.local at boot-time.
