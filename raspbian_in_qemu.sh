# raspbian_in_qemu.sh - Does what it says on the tin.  Requires that you have
#    qemu-system-arm installed and that it supports the arm1176 processor.
#    Takes two arguments, the kernel to boot and the disk image to mount.

# Notes:
# v1 RasPi's only have 256 MB of RAM.  v2 RasPi's have 512 MB.  Some in the
# community seem to have decided that defaulting to 256 MB is safest, but if
# you want to try larger amounts of memory feel free to do so.

# The evocation of QEMU came from this page, which I learned from:
#    http://xecdesign.com/qemu-emulating-raspberry-pi-the-easy-way/

# The serial port is redirected to the terminal you executed this script from,
# so you have direct access to the virtual unit if the X window goes wonky for
# whatever reason.

# Count the number of command line arguments passed to the script.  ABEND if
# we're missing a few.
