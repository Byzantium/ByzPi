Uncompress the source code to QwebIRC into this directory.  By that, I don't
mean qwebirc-qwebirc-<some hash here>, I mean that all of the source code
needs to be decompressed into this directory as if this directory was
qwebirc-qwebirc-<some hash here>.

To build the .deb package, execute the command `debuild`.  Sit back and watch.
