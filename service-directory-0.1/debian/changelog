service-directory (0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Haxwithaxe made some serious changes to the code to clean it up a little
    and make it more flexible.  This is a new build of the package with his
    new code in it.
  * Fixed the initscript so that it handles service dependencies properly.
    It'll only run after the avahi-daemon initscript now.
